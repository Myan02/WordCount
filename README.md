WordCount:

A program to count the frequency of words in a large text file

We will be using texts from https://www.gutenberg.org/


Myan02 -> Michael Baburyan

AndresR20 -> Andres Rodriguez

Things to do to correctly run the program:

1. Create a text file to store 'War and Peace' in order to be able to read the file and extract its contents.

2. Create another text file to copy results into it (ex: results.txt). For this step, you would need to use your own specific directory. For example, if you go to your files where your results.txt file is, if you hold the shift key on your keyboard and right click on the file, it will list out some options. There is an option to 'copy path'. If you select this, you can then copy and paste this into the 'with open()' function (Ex: "C:\Users\rodri\OneDrive\Documents\VS\result.txt"). Make sure to add an extra '\\' right next to the slashes already in the example in order for it to run properly (Ex: "C:\\\Users\\\rodri\\\OneDrive\\\Documents\\\VS\\\result.txt").

Doing these two things will ensure you get the correct output.
